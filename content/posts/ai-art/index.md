It's been a strange year to be a digital creative, or fan of them. First the NFT boom attempted to redefine art ownership into a harebrained scheme of artificial scarcity, then the past few months of your various social media feeds have been inundated with the creations of advanced text-to-image AI models, creators decrying them, and tech evangelists handwaving the former group's concerns away as if they were Luddites.

Broadly, I am on the critics' side here. As elitist and frankly pointless as the "it's not *real* art" argument sounds, it is true these so-called "artificial intelligence" tools don't see the world with emotion. They are all, at their core, just huge equations, informed by terabytes of questionably-gathered human creativity, that turn thing A (prompt) into thing B (images or more text) with a bit of randomness injected in that looks like creativity to an uninformed observer. As such, I really don't believe at this time that most halfway competent artists with a clear vision have to worry about rogue algorithms taking their jobs.

That being said, the ethical travesty of training these models without almost any knowledge or permission by creators, some *deceased* creators no less, should never have been allowed. In an ideal world, it certainly shouldn't continue to occur. But convincing the likes of Microsoft (sponsor of OpenAI) to delete all existing models and go back to square one is just not going to happen now; they want returns on their investment. So what comes next?
## The platform problem: To ban or not to ban?
AI generated work has a nasty habit of completely taking over whatever online platform it's posted on. It's almost as if these platforms are already controlled by recommender algorithms that reward the frequent posting enabled by the speed of AI tools! Without any action, human artists will simply be unable to keep up. That being said, I don't think AI generations should be banned entirely from large platforms. Smaller, focused communities are one thing, but if everywhere is off limits, bad actors will undoubtedly try to get away with posting it anyway. Since the few surefire tells of AI will disappear as the tech improves, witch hunting for anything that *looks* a little too AI generated could proliferate, hurting real creators in the process.

For now, the best thing art sharing platforms could do is relegate it to its own section or tag, that people can easily hide (or even hide it by default), and require all posts to link back to the generator, prompt, exact settings used, and time of creation. That way, for instance, the model could be reviewed if it duplicates an existing work too closely.

Finally, platforms should have a clear policy on AI training that **opts out all users by default**. Seriously, don't be DeviantArt or ArtStation. Sites made *for* artists should have the most responsibility to protect artists. If you spent all that time protecting against right-click-saves of NFTs, figure out how to do the same against unauthorized data scrapers for AI. The end result will be a much smaller dataset available, but in any field of science, the ethical path is never without sacrifices.
## Toy or tool? Reviewing NovelAI
Since these tools aren't going anywhere, I decided to play around with a few popular AI tools to see if there's any merit to lightly AI-assisted creativity, or if prompt-wrangling is more effort than it's worth. A few months back I discovered [NovelAI](https://novelai.net/), initially through their admittedly impressive anime-focused text to image model, but their core service is a fiction co-writing tool that seemed perfect for salvaging my aging collection of bizarre short story ideas from dreams I had. I signed up for their $15/mo middle tier, and got to work.
### Story writing
{{<figure src="images/nai writing interface.png" alt="A three-panel web interface with list of stories on the left, main story text in the center, and AI parameters on the right." caption="The NovelAI interface">}}

After completing the site's basic tutorial and digging into the Euterpe model's dizzying array of options and parameters, my first attempt at a story was a sci-fi thriller about a town where the night sky is suddenly replaced with a Windows blue screen-like error message, causing the townspeople to slowly discover they are in a computer simulation that is about to be reset. The idea originated from the LOCAL58 video [Weather Service](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M75VLQuFPrY). For a brief time after watching this, my mind raced at night about what could be right outside my closed bedroom curtains. I've shelved it for now because it was just too abstract a story based on such a distant and inexplicable fear, so any attempt at verbalizing it turned it into something else.

However, this did force me to learn the ins and outs of AI co-writing, that the site doesn't teach you. Tags and summaries in your story's metadata, separating scenes, using the "Lorebook" tool to save descriptions of nouns, experimenting with presets that change the output, all of these have been carefully documented by the NovelAI community. The one thing I wasn't doing, though, was just writing. When you present me with all these options, of course I'll want to get all of them perfect before starting! This is the writing equivalent of spending the first 2 hours of a PC game tinkering with graphics settings for the best performance! It doesn't help that whenever I *tried* to use the AI, I already had an idea for where the story was going next, so it inevitably wrote in a direction I didn't want or got characters and concepts all mixed up. In that sense it is like having a co-writer: it can't read your mind, so taking time to explain context is paramount. Except here, explaining could happen in four different text boxes and half the time it spits your words back out at you or forgets which way is up. Supposedly their newer, fancier model Krake is a bit better with this stuff, but I can't really drop $25/mo to find out.

My second story, you may have seen already! [Maizie in the Mountains: A Holiday Adventure](https://www.emiabo.com/library/posts/maizie-christmas/) was almost entirely written by me. A fairytale story featuring our real cat, I wrote it as a Christmas gift complete with a pixel art cover. By this point I had begun using the "Author's Note" field to rein in Euterpe's outputs within a scene. This is discouraged in the community because the newer models weren't trained with this data field so they can break, but for my purposes it was the single most useful tip for taming the AI dream logic into something useful.

There's much more ground to explore here, so I may keep my sub going a few more months and write a few more things in it. It seems that NovelAI was at least partially made as a successor to AI Dungeon, going so far as to introduce a "text adventure" mode and allow importing scenarios from that game, and many of the default prompts incorporate fantasy tropes and LitRPG-style character sheets. The devs are also clearly...enthusiasts for Japanese pop culture, providing several text generator modules not-so-subtly trained on the likes of the *Monogatari* series, *Spice and Wolf*, *Sword Art Online* and some undiscernable isekai series. Not to mention, as members of the official subreddit will bring up, it is one of the only tools on the market now that allows uncensored NSFW content creation, many a weeb's favorite pastime...

So far, for most fiction writers, I can only really recommend this as a brainstorming tool. If you have the first few sentences, but have totally hit a wall, maybe it'll give you a spark. But once the plot beats are all in your head, it's nearly always easier to just write them down yourself and revise the wording later. The developers clearly seem to understand the limitations of current text models, which is why they designed this as a back-and-forth co-writing tool that encourages users to take what works and replace what doesn't in the GPT word salad. But the competition is fierce, with venture-backed tools like [Sudowrite](https://www.sudowrite.com/) allowing not only generation of new text but AI-powered *rewriting* of passages in a variety of stylistic directions. (It also claims to offer AI "beta readers" emblazoned with the likenesses of real dead authors, which seems a bit...yikes).
### Image generation
Enough about boring fiction! Almost *all* the attention NovelAI has received has been in the months since they launched their own contender in the diffusion image generator wars, with a remarkable knack for anime characters. It was trained from imageboard [Danbooru](https://safebooru.donmai.us/), and its resulting tag-based prompt system sets it apart from the mainstream tools like DALL-E or Midjourney. Rather than a plain English prompt ("An illustration of a tabby cat laying in a meadow in an impressionist style"), a NAI prompt is more like "1girl, medium brown hair, green eyes, sweater, orange background". As someone always on the lookout for character creators, I naturally couldn't resist.

My first couple generations weren't bad, but kind of bland. Some hardcore users spend hours tinkering on the order of tags, `{{{emphasizing}}}` some and `[[[demoting]]]` others, but I haven't really had the time, patience, or generator credits for that, so eventually I started feeding in old avatars through the image-to-image mode. A few of the resulting artstyle changes were actually kinda cute!

At this point the drawbacks were becoming more apparent, though. The strange artifacts and uncomfortable anatomy, for one thing. These can mostly be retouched by hand later, but the bigger issue is limited capacity for defining multiple characters at once, or defining backgrounds in general. The tags just don't allow for that kind of granularity. The reason I kept all of these on solid-color backdrops is so I could composite them atop one later.

Look, I was going to do more with this, given its popularity means it will probably be NovelAI's bread and butter going forward, but honestly these image generators have already become so commonplace that they don't interest me as much as the text space. Maybe my opinion on this tool would evolve with more usage, but for now, if I'm in an artistic mood, I think I'd rather sketch something in my own style (even if it's garbage) than play this exhausting game with prompts and sliders.
## Conclusion
Just in the month I've been writing this, the craze continues to evolve. [Character.AI](https://beta.character.ai/) brings just as much humor from the "AI greentext" days as future questions about impersonation and parasociality. Meanwhile, there's the new reigning champ of text generators supposedly poised to "kill the college essay", ChatGPT. I considered deep diving into those, but they're beyond the scope of what I wanted to say here about "art", and honestly the world will soon be so inundated with bland AI-generated ad copy and blogspam that the situation will speak for itself. So for now, listen to some human-made music, watch a film, or admire some lovingly crafted pixel art. I think it'll be some time before robots crack the code on those.

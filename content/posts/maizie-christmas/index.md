Once upon a time, there was a curious kitten named Maizie. Along with her mother and siblings, she lived in an old house on a quiet hillside. Although the cats had lots of room to play and explore amidst the evergreen trees, their mother didn't always have the best luck with catching food, and winters were especially difficult. The other critters hibernated when the snow fell, and there was little left for the family to eat except the spiders that lived in their attic.

One frigid day, the kittens' mother came home from hunting empty-handed and put her head down by her water bowl to drink up before getting ready for bed. The bowl, really a plastic takeout container, was pushed against a corner so that it collected the drippings of the snow-covered roof above. The cool water refreshed the feline's thirst, and not long after, her family carefully hopped down the stairs to hear the news about her catches.

"Ma!" meowed Garth excitedly. "Did ya bring back any fish? Mice? Birds?"

"Sadly, the river has finally frozen over, the ground critters are going to sleep for the winter, and the birds have mostly flown south. Looks like we'll be having the flies for dinner again" replied Ma. The freshly fallen snow didn't feel great under her aging paws, either.

"Aww..." Garth had only just recently begun to eat solid food, but he had already become quite the little gourmet. His favorite food so far was rabbit, although Ma was only lucky enough to run into one once.

"Cheer up, Garth" Maizie said as she trotted up behind them. "They're really fun to catch at least! We'd be a lot worse off if I hadn't found them." Ma had, actually, but decided to let the kitten have her satisfaction. The cats headed upstairs, keeping their eyes and ears peeled for buzzing bees and crawling creatures. After dinner, they tucked into the attic, cushioned with old blankets left on the floor, and they fell asleep to the lullaby of gusting wind.

A bright light and jingling bells awoke Maizie from her slumber. Being the most vigilant of the litter, she quietly arose and approached the window, standing on her hind legs to survey the scene. The forest outside the window was filled with fir trees, dusted with powdery snow. Maizie's stomach growled after her lackluster supper. She decided to return to bed and warm up with the others, but at that moment, she spotted a small creature moving quickly between the trees. A squirrel! Or so she thought as she nearly leapt for the door and began in pursuit of it. Ma would be upset with her for wandering out alone, but the tasty rodent would surely make up for it!

As Maizie closed in on the creature, she noticed it looked quite different from the ones Ma had brought back before. It was running on two legs, had smooth and shiny skin rather than fur, the top of its head was pointy and green, and strangest of all, its eyes were glowing like moonlight onto the ground ahead of it. It huffed and puffed as its spindly legs struggled through the snow, giving Maizie an opening to pounce! She trapped the creature between her brown paws.

"Wait! Don't eat me!!" the creature yelped. Somehow, Maizie could understand it, and she meowed back in surprise. "What are you? You're not a squirrel!"

"What? No, I'm a delivery elf! And I have to get to town and get back on Santa's sleigh!" He managed to wriggle out of Maizie's grip for a moment, but she handily caught his leg. "Let me go, kitty!"

"Who's this Santa anyway?" Maizie was already disappointed. This...thing seemed more mechanical than meat. Her mother would think she had run off to chase a toy!

"You don't know? Well, I suppose you are a stray, and in this far-off forest no less. Tonight is Christmas, a very special night. A jolly old human called Santa brings gifts to all the children who've been good this year. Not just other humans, but dogs and cats like you, too! The people think he slinks down their chimneys one by one and deposits gifts under their trees, but that would take far too long, so his workshop builds thousands of mechanical delivery elves like us!"

"Where are you going, then? There's not many people out in this forest." Maizie's mother had told the kittens all about humans. They walked on two legs, kept cats in their houses, and served up food every day. Sounded like a nice life, but Ma must have had her reasons for running away.

"Santa has to land for a few minutes in every town so we can all deliver to our assigned houses and get back on the sleigh. But I've been left behind! If I don't get to the next town soon, I'll never catch up!" His panicked expression softened a bit. "Say, you can run through the snow much faster than I can. If you'd give me a ride to town, I'm sure Santa would be happy to give you a gift, too!"

Even though Maizie was the fastest runner of her litter, her short fur provided little protection from the cold breeze stiffening her bones as the pair approached the lights of town. "Say," the kitten wondered aloud, "how come I can understand you? I've never seen a live mouse or fish that could speak cat!"

"So we can talk to the humans' pets if they catch us while we're delivering!" the elf exclaimed, trying his best to hold on. He had lost many a comrade to rogue dogs before this feature was made standard. "Don't stress the specifics, it's just to make sure the people aren't woken up at any cost!"

Exiting the forest, there were more houses than Maizie had ever seen in one place before. They came in all shapes and sizes, and a few even had light pouring out their windows - a sure sign of humans! Her pace slowed as she approached a distinct break in the snow cover: a road, which Ma had taught her was one of the most dangerous places for a cat. Huge, loud creatures with four or even more wheels could come screaming across at any time! It seemed quiet now, though, so she carefully crossed.

Turning a corner between the rows of homes, Maizie was presented with an astonishing sight. A tall, lone tree stood in a paved square, breaking up the rows of buildings. In many ways it looked just like the many others that dotted the forest she had just left, but unlike those, it shimmered with lights all along its boughs! Before it was a large red sleigh carrying a burlap sack, surrounded by carefully wrapped gift boxes carried by the elves single-file like a colony of ants. "Ah, that's a relief," the elf said, "I wasn't sure if this was a drop point! Santa only lands in towns where there's a Christmas tree in a public place, like this one."

The pair continued through the streets, passing more colorfully decorated houses. They looked so warm...Maizie had been running in the cold without food this whole time, and wasn't going to hold out much longer. Suddenly, she slipped on a patch of ice and took a tumble, coating her paws, face, and chest with snow, and there she laid for a long while.

"Kitty! We can do this, it's just one more block!" The clockwork courier elf had returned to his feet after being thrown off, unaffected by the cold. He pushed Maizie up on her four paws, and walked close beside her as the two slowly approached the sleigh, which by this point was ready for takeoff.

"WAAAIT!! Santa!" the elf used his remaining power to shout as he jumped up right onto the front of the sleigh. "This stray kitten here! We missed her house!" Santa looked over at the cat, and the sleigh's reins nearly fell out of his gloved hands. He stepped out of the sleigh, and kneeled down to the frightened feline. "Ho ho, no need to be so scared. It seems checking my list twice wasn't enough! I'm afraid I don't have a gift wrapped and ready for you, but..." -- he pulled out a palm-sized gift box from his back pocket -- "that's why I keep a few of these. A magic gift box. With this, you can make one wish. That Christmas magic isn't easy to collect, you know, so use it wisely."

Maizie, with her remaining strength, leaned in and sniffed the box in Santa's palm, pushing the lid off and revealing a spark of faintly red and green light. At that moment, she wished for her family to never go cold and hungry again. The one spark started to multiply into many, spiraling around her towards the sky. A few brushed up against the snow covering her, turning it into warm fur. Eventually the sparks fully encircled the feline, and just like that, she disappeared.

Santa turned back towards the sleigh. "Thank you for finding that little one. Don't tell the others, but the Silver Bell award might be in your future. Now, let's get back on schedule!" The elf decided to take this in stride, not mentioning that he was just trying to catch up from missing the last stop. He pranced back into the elf quarters beneath the seat of the sleigh, and with Santa at the reins once again, the reindeer propelled them into the sky.

When Maizie awoke, she was in a warm, plain room, perched on a carpeted tower alongside her siblings, and a few other cats were playing with toys in the same room. A large window provided a view outside: A concrete jungle, with scattered parked cars and people, and a backlit sign - "Animal Shelter".
Maizie's ears perked up as the door behind her opened.
